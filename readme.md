# Clear Anger Diary
This game was created by me as I was in an intervirew and asked if I can learn two Js libraries which are matter js and sketch.js
**MAtter.js** is a JS is a library used for 2D physics simulation.
**Sketch.js** it is also a Js library used to draw using js.

So I have made a game in which there are four characters in which three are angry and one is happy ball. Happy ball is attached with a string which is used to throw the happy ball to the angry faces and cick them outside the screen.
